1. Why using this chat ?
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px;">
It can be used if you want a quick access, free and anonymous chat service<br />
<?php echo $lng['product'];?> can be a discussion channel. Example :
<?php echo $url_base; ?>?chats<br />
It can also be used if your connection is content-limited (by ISP or computer's administrator).</p>
<br />
2. Do i need an account to access channels ?<br />
<br />
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
Nothing will be asked to you.
To enter a chat room, you just have to know the name or randomly generate one.<br />
</div>
<br />
3. Why does my pseudo is automatically generated ?<br />
<br />
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
Pseudo is only useful to follow up the conversation.
<br />If you have to enter a pseudo, accessing a chat room won't be step free.<br />
</div>
<br />
4. Who can access to my chat room ?
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px;">
Everyone !
Chat room where not restricted, you just have to know it name !<br />
So you just have to choice a sophisticated name. By example : <?php echo $url_base; ?>?tfderv<br />
It have length of 6 character, so the probability finding this name is one in more than 50 billions.<br />
Imagine with longer names !</p>
<br />
5. How can i access to a chat room quickly ?
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px;">
From home, you can type the name on the left quick access zone.<br />
<b>Other quick access&nbsp;:</b>
(replace &lt;roomname&gt; by an other one )<br />
<?php echo $url_base; ?>?room=&lt;roomname&gt;<br />
<?php echo $url_base; ?>?&lt;roomname&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">6. How many times my conversation will be saved ?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px;">
Messages are always present when a user is active. Beyond this moment, they are erased after 10 minutes.<br />
You can use erase button too if you want to leave place empty.</p>
<br />
7. How can it protect me from censorship our content-limited software ?<br />
<br />
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
This chat is encrypted (even if it isn't HTTPS)
It use AES-256 algorithm, used at "SECRET" and "TOP SECRET" by us government.<br />
There where no decrypting robot actually to view this chat messages.<br />
It's only for protect you from filtering and automatic method of censorship.
By exemple to use with public wifi or business connection.<br />
If someone hack the chat server, he only can see encrypted messages.
The only way to decrypt is knowing the room name.
